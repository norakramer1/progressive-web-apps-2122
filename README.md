# Progressive Web Apps @cmda-minor-web · 2021/22

## About this project
For this course we rebuilt our Single Page App into a serverside-rendered Progressive Web App. Using Node.js, express and EJS we rendered the app serverside. After this I implemented a service worker to install the app and use it locally. 

## Install node, NPM and Express
I started by updating my version of Node.JS and NPM using Node Version Manager. If you want to install from scratch go to the [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) website. Once Node was installed I followed the Node [Getting Started Guide](https://nodejs.org/en/docs/guides/getting-started-guide/), which helps you through setting up a simple https server and displaying 'Hello World' on localhost {port}.

After that I started with Express. I navigated to my project directory to `npm init`. This makes a `package.json` file to store, among other things, dependencies. I installed Express using `npm install express`. After that i added a render function to my app.js to render the `index.html` file in my directory.
